/**
 * CSS minification provider
 * 
 * Enter the class name of the CSS minification provider you want to use. The class must be found
 * inside a file with the same name (UpperCamelCased plus .php extension) located in the folder
 * Tollwerk\Squeezr\Css\Minifier, and it must implement the interface Tollwerk\Squeezr\Css\Minifier.
 * 
 * Currently only "Minify" as a minification provider is implemented, and squeezr comes with a
 * copy of Minify preinstalled (you can find it under SQUEEZR_ROOT/plugins/minify). Minify is a
 * great project of it's own, please visit it at it's homepage or at it's GitHub repository:
 * 
 * @link		https://code.google.com/p/minify/
 * @github		https://github.com/mrclay/minify
 * 
 * If you do not want to use CSS minification provide NULL here.
