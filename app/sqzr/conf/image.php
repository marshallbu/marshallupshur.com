 * Copy undersized images
 * 
 * Enabling this feature will produce real copies of your original images in case they are smaller
 * than a specific breakpoint (and thus don't need to be downsampled) and your system doesn't support
 * symlinks. Please be aware that this will lead to significantly higher disk space requirements, but

/**
 * 8-bit PNG quantizer
 *
 * When downscaling 8-bit PNG images, the resulting images have to be re-quantized. squeezr comes with
 * some internal quantizing logic (based on GD), but the results aren't that good. If available, you
 * should use an external quantizer like "pngquant" or "pngnq". The following quantizer options are
 * available:
 * 
 * - FALSE: Disable re-quantizing altogether (potentially resulting in huge PNG files)
 * - "internal", NULL or empty string: Internal quantizer (GD based)
 * - "pngquant": pngquant command line quantizer (must be available on the system)
 * - "pngnq": pngnq command line quantizer (must be available on the system)

/**
 * External 8-bit PNG quantizer speed
 * 
 * If an external quantizer is used (like "pngquant" or "pngnq"), you can control the quality the
 * resulting PNG files will have. Higher quality means longer processing time. Provider an integer
 * value between 1 and 10 here, with 1 meaning highest quality / slowest processing and 10 meaning
 * poorest quality, but fastest processing.
